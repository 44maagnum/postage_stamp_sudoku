Postage stamp sudoku is an attempt to write a sudoku solver that is concise enough to fit on a postage stamp. I didn't have a hard limit in mind when I started. The goal was just to write a funcioning program using the fewest characters possible. 

Structure:
The input board is defined in the file board.h. The board is simply an array of 81 integers. The 0 digit signifies a blank square. 

Algorithm:
The solver uses an efficient backtracking algorithm. Though using this algorithm requires slightly more code, it solves puzzles remarkably fast in practice. 

Readable file:
The file postage_stamp_sudoku_expanded.c contains a version of the program that is more readable than the postage stamp version. This version is not identical, but it uses the same algorithm.
